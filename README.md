# oskarmendel.me-watch
A web application with the functionality of playing videos asynchronous for all connected clients.
Note: the virtual env folder is just here temporary since i had problems with it while transfering it to my server.

## Setting up
You can set this package up with a virtualenv:
```
$ virtualenv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
```
Then you install the dependencies located in requirements.txt:
```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you can feel free to run the application:
```
(venv) $ python app.py
```
